/* This has been tested with dynamic workspaces. It works well with dynamic workspaces, but can work well with static if you have enough static ones.
 * Works well with external monitor as well, the idea being windows opened on external monitor are meant for just that monitor.
 * Any caveats that come with the way gnome handles multi monitor setups will remain as we do not try to address those here.
 */

/* Possible future options:
 *  Target a specific desktop when none are empty (for static, not in immediate roadmap). People can create issues with feature requests if they want.
 *  (don't) skip first desktop
 *  Expose some of the hard coded things as preferences if someones asks for them.
